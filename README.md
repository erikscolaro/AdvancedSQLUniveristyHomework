# DataWarehouse&DataScienceUniversityHomework

## Overview
This repository contains my homework assignments and projects for the Data Science and Technologies for Data Base course. The work demonstrates practical applications of database technologies, data warehousing concepts, and data analysis techniques using both SQL and NoSQL approaches. The assignments focus on real-world scenarios such as public transport analysis and bike sharing systems.

## Tools Used
- **Oracle Database** (including Extended SQL, Materialized Views, and Triggers)
- **SQL** (for writing complex queries and relational algebra expressions)
- **Data Warehouse Design Techniques** (conceptual and logical schema design)
- **MongoDB** (including Atlas, Compass, and Shell)
- **MapReduce Paradigm** (for alternative aggregation in MongoDB)

## Topics Covered
- **Public Transport Revenue Analysis**  
    Analysis of ticket sales, travel duration, revenue per transport line, and aggregated statistics across cities, provinces, and regions.

- **Data Warehouse Design**  
    Designing conceptual and logical schemas (fact and dimension tables) for urban transport data.

- **SQL Query Development and Optimization**  
    Writing extended SQL queries for daily averages, cumulative counts, percentage calculations, and ranking; translating queries into algebraic expressions; and optimizing query performance with physical structures.

- **Materialized Views and Trigger-Based Maintenance**  
    Creating and updating materialized views and their logs to reduce query response time, as well as implementing triggers to manage view updates.

- **NoSQL Data Analysis with MongoDB**  
    Querying a bike stations dataset for status filtering, aggregation of reviews, scores, and spatial queries using 2dsphere indexes.
